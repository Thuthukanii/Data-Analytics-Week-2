# Data-Analytics-Week-2
The analytics process.
Data is acquired, it is then cleaned and manipulated. Analysed thoroughly then visualisation is implemented. Reports are done based on data analysed.

Descriptive analytics is like taking a snapshot of what's happening in your data right now. It's the first step in data analysis, where you try to understand and summarize the main characteristics of your data. Imagine you have a bunch of numbers representing sales from different stores over the past year. Descriptive analytics would help you answer questions like: What was the average sales per store? What was the total sales? What was the highest and lowest sales recorded? It's all about organizing, summarizing, and presenting your data in a way that's easy to understand, so you can get a clear picture of what's going on without digging too deep into complex analysis techniques.

Predictive analytics is like looking into a crystal ball to forecast what might happen in the future based on patterns and trends in your data. Let's say you have data on past sales,
 customer demographics, and advertising spending. Predictive analytics would use this information to make educated guesses about future sales, customer behavior, or advertising effectiveness. It's like using the past to predict what's likely to happen next. This can be super helpful for businesses because it allows them to anticipate trends, make smarter decisions, and even plan ahead more effectively.

Prescriptive analytics is like having a wise advisor who not only tells you what's likely to happen in the future but also suggests the best actions to take. It goes beyond just predicting outcomes; it recommends specific steps to achieve desired results. Imagine you run a delivery service and want to minimize delivery times. Prescriptive analytics would not only forecast traffic patterns but also suggest the most efficient routes for your drivers to take. It's all about using data to not only understand what might happen but also to guide you on what you should do about it. This can help businesses make more informed decisions and optimize their strategies for better outcomes.

Tabular data is data organized into a table, made up of columns and rows. A table represents information about a single topic. Each column represents a uniquely named field within a table, also called a variable, about a single characteristic.

Unstructured data is any type of data that does not fit neatly into the tabular model. 
Examples of unstructured data include digital images, audio recordings, video recordings, and open-ended survey responses eg. Binary

Quantitative data consists of numeric values. Data elements whose values come from counting or measuring are quantitative.
Qualitative data consists of frequent text values. Data elements whose values describe characteristics, traits, and attitudes are all qualitative.
    
Structured data fits well into CSV files, a popular format for exchanging data via flat files.
A complex data structure, you need capabilities beyond what a flat-file provides. Formatting the data as JSON or XML is a viable alternative.
